A complete blood cell count is an important test in medical diagnosis to evaluate overall health condition. Traditionally blood cells are counted manually using haemocytometer along with other laboratory equipmentâ€™s and chemical compounds, which is a time-consuming and tedious task. In this work, the authors present a machine learning approach for automatic identification and counting of three types of blood cells using Mask-RCNN image classification algorithm. Mask-RCNN framework has been trained with BCCD Dataset of blood smear images to automatically identify red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
